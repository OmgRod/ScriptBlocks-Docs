# Sprites

Sprites are a fundamental concept when developing using ScriptBlocks, so in this tutorial, we are going to show you how to make sprites.

## Loading the Sprite

First, we need to initialise our project. So, in main.py, we type the following:

```py
import scriptblocks
```

After this, it's time to create our sprite! So, we type the following:

```py
testSprite = scriptblocks.Sprite("test")
```

This loads a sprite from the sidebar with the name `test`.
